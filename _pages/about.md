I am [a photographer](https://drdavidpotter.github.io/portfolio/) and a post-doctoral research associate in [linguistics](https://drdavidpotter.github.io/files/PotterCV.pdf) at Morehead State University. My photography focuses on photojournalistic and travel genres, but I also enjoy portraiture and product work. In [my linguistics research](https://drdavidpotter.github.io/research/), I use experimental methodologies to examine the syntax of elliptical and information structural phenomena. I have presented my research at international conferences all over the world and have numerous publications in leading academic journals. I also have formal training as an English language instructor, with 7+ years experience.

I was born in Ca√±on City, Colorado, but spent most of my youth in the pacific northwest. Since then, I've lived a great many places, including South Korea, British Columbia, France, Chicago, Lebanon, and, for most of the past three years, Morehead, Kentucky. My passions beyond photography include cooking, hiking, cycling, working on my VW, and mushroom farming.
